There are 4 (four) curves plotted on each pad, and every image contains 2 (two) pads.
The curves are formed by 4 (four) points, each corresponding, on the horizontal axis, to the center of the line/column in the given direction (x,y), while the vertial axis correspondes to the normalized yield.

The black curves are those plotted from the "raw" data, without any calibration.
The red curves are plotted using the Image model from YpixModel(), using the position (Xp,Yp) calculated by the more_outpos2 program.
The green curves are plotted using the Image model from YpixModel(), using the position (Xh,Yh) from the holes on the aluminium cover used as a collimator.
The blue curves are those plotted from the calibrated data.
